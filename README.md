## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Rastko, a smart contract developer from Serbia. I have been working with smart contracts for the past several years, with experience in developing, testing, and deploying dApps on various blockchain networks (Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, etc.).

In addition to smart contracts, I also work on backend development, most often using NestJS. The programming languages I use most frequently are Rust, Solidity, and TypeScript/JavaScript. Beyond blockchain, I am interested in distributed systems, decentralization, security, and transparency.

I enjoy mathematics, and in my free time, I work with zero-knowledge proofs, teach people programming and mathematics, and prepare them for exams, certifications, and competitions.
